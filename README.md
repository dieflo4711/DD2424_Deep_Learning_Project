# ResNet-18 on Tiny ImageNet

This project explored the effect of data augmentation on a neural network trained from scratch with an 18 layer deep Residual neural Network (ResNet-18) structure.The dataset Tiny ImageNet was used for training, validation, and testing. The dataaugmentation tested was random crop, random flip, combined random flip and cropas well as color jitter. A test accuracy of 31% was increased to 55% by using dataaugmentation. The results therefore shows that using data augmentation improves the performance of the network
